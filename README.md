# Background Task Sample for WPF (Desktop Bridge)
This repository contains an example of using Background Task in WPF using the Desktop Bridge. 
It is a sample project for a question on StackOverflow ([Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64371240/wpf-desktop-bridge-out-of-process-background-task-cannot-access-documents-folder "Link")). BG task uses the Documents folder, which works correctly only with Windows 2004.
